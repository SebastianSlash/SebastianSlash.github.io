    <p>Those are some of the things I like to do whenever I can. </p>

  <div class="o_projects">
    <h1>Projects</h1>
    <p>
      I'm also working on some projects, mostly tech related and mainly coding.
      I just dont have time to get them all done.
    </p>
    <p class="ticker">So many Ideas!</p>
    <a href="https://github.com/SebastianSlash" class="call_action">see on GitHub</a>

  <div class="o_impossible">
    <h1>Impossible List</h1>
    <p class="ticker">The Bucket List 2.0 - Evolved</p>
    <p>I got inspired to create this by Thomas Frank from <a href="https://collegeinfogeek.com">College Info Geek</a>.
    <br>it's basicly a list of goals I want to achive and beyond.</p>
    <a href="pages/impossibble-list.html" class="call_action">Go check it out!</a>
  </div>

  <div class="o_podcast">
    <h1>The Podcast</h1>
    <p class="ticker">I think best when cycling.</p>
    <p>So I thought: "Why not think loudly and record it for you?".
    <br>That's how the Idea of a Bikepacking - Cycling Adventure Podcast came to life.</p>
    <a href="pages/podcast.html" class="call_action">Join me!</a>
    <p>On my rides all over the place and even learn a thing or two.</p>
