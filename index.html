<div class="o_impossible">
  <h1>Impossible List</h1>

<div class="o_podcast">
  <h1>The Podcast</h1>
  <p class="ticker">I think best when cycling.</p>
  <p>So I thought: "Why not think loudly and record it for you?".
  <br>That's how the Idea of a Bikepacking - Cycling Adventure Podcast came to life.</p>
  <a href="pages/podcast.html" class="call_action">Join me!</a>
  <p>On my rides all over the place and even learn a thing or two.</p>

  <div id="blog_tech">
    <h1>Tech Blog</h1>
