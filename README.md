The ruby environment for jekyll was setup with rbenv on Arch linux by following [this](https://levikouablan.net/articles/my-blog-with-jekyll-2/) guide.

After cloning or downloading the repository run Terminal in directory:
```bash
$ bundle update
```

and start the jekyll server with:
```bash
$ bundle exec jekyll serve --livereload
```

*the --livereload option automatically refreshes the page after a change has been built*
