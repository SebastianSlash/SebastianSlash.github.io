    <h1>Music Routine App</h1>
    <p>
      Recently I've started to develop an app which is intended as a practicing tool for musicians.
      The Idea is to have an app where you create exercises, like scales, and also be able to incoperate them in practice routines.
    </p>
    <p>Wheather you play the Piano, Guitar or Saxophone this app can be used for any instrument.</p>

    <p>
      Currently the app is a very minimal working example showcasing the basic idea behind it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Please give me lots of feedback.
    </p>
    <div class="form-provider">
      <div class="cta-button feedback" onclick="window.open('https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeI5XzLX6tXOL1uLaAMY43DdZc7wmj8QIL1EtVyTP8gGvkmTg/viewform?usp=sf_link');">

      <div class="cta-button bug-report" onclick="window.open('https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeL2aTFyObLZKAgQMQqpPgWDvZ_a8Wpb_ZbLZE1h9OFuSbdSQ/viewform?usp=sf_link');">
        <span>file bug report</span>
      </div>
    </div>




    <p>
      If you want to test the app before the offical open test release you can become part of the internal test group.
      When you're part of the test group you help my developement process by providing valuable and needed feedback, reporting bugs and usability issuses.

    </ul>
    <h2>Features</h2>
    <p>
      Create exercises you use to practice an instrument.
      Exercises can vary in complexity and are comprised of at least one interval.
    </p>
    <p>
      An interval describes what you have to do for that part of the exercise, it can have a metronome and/or a timer.
    </p>
    <p>
      When you practice your exercise you will see the interval desrciption a metronome indicator and timer indicator if applicable.
      After a exercise is done you will be asked for feedback to (in the future) adapt your exercise to your current level.
    </p>
    <p>
      The app also includes a plain metronome that can be used without any exercises.
